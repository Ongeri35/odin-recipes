        <h1>Pork fried rice</h1>
        <p>This pork fried rice recipe is my revised version of another recipe. I often substitute chicken for pork, and it doesn't change anything. I have used both basmati rice and long-grain rice which gives the dish only a slight flavor difference. I have also added celery in the past with good outcomes.</p>
